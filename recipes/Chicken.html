<p>This particular ping gai (Laotian for 'grilled chicken') recipe seems to have originated from the Queen Mother Cafe in
Toronto, so some North-Americanization may have occurred. But rest assured, this is at least twice as good as your
average grilled chicken, North American or otherwise. Generous amounts of freshly ground pepper and chopped cilantro are
the main players in the marinade, while a sweet, garlicky dipping sauce is the perfect accompaniment.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 large bunch fresh cilantro stems and leaves</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 pinches cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add
        chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
    </li>
    
    <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
    
    <li>
        Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred
        and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read
        at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
